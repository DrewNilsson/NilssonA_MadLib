//Peer Reviewed by Amardeep Mann: Really good work! Clever to store both the questions and the inputs in arrays. It made things surprisingly easy to follow. While loops work well for both the play-again and data validation. Really liked that you were able to "for loop" the questions with a quick string concatenation. The Console.Clear() between games is a nice touch to keep things uncluttered. Good work!
